Runs on ANUGA Hydro open source hydrodynamic modelling tool

For detailed information visit : https://anuga.anu.edu.au/

## Quick introduction to ANUGA
Visit https://github.com/stoiver/anuga-clinic-2018

Open any notebook ( for exmaple :Notebook1! )

click Open in Colab icon ( i hope you already have google account)

and run code


## Prerequisities

* Install miniconda 

* Install anuga 

* Run UShapedBay.py

* To visualize SWW files install anuga viewer
